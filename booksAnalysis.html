								The Stranger by Albert Camus is a philosophical novel that explores themes of existentialism, 
								absurdity, and the meaning of life. The story centers on Meursault, an emotionally detached 
								Algerian man who lives a seemingly indifferent and apathetic life. After the death of his mother, 
								Meursault becomes involved in an accidental murder, leading to a trial where his lack of conventional 
								emotions becomes the focus. Through Meursault’s experiences, Camus examines the absurdity of human 
								existence and the conflict between society’s expectations and individual freedom, ultimately 
								questioning the very nature of meaning and truth in life.

							In The Stranger, Camus explores the themes of existentialism and the absurdity of life, illustrating

							ultimate fate, Camus critiques the ways society imposes its own meanings on individuals, forcing them 
							to conform. In the end, The Stranger challenges the reader to confront the absurdity of existence and

							Across the ages and around the globe, literary masterpieces have been penned by
							iconic authors who left indelible marks on literature. From William Shakespeare's
							profound exploration of human nature in his plays to Edgar Allan Poe's chilling 
							tales of the macabre, and Fyodor Dostoevsky's philosophical musings on morality 
							and the human psyche, these works span a wide range of genres and themes. 
							Albert Camus challenged existential concepts with his absurdist narratives, 
							while Gabriel García Márquez mesmerized readers with the magical realism of 
							Latin America. The wisdom of Sun Tzu’s The Art of War and the teachings of 
							Confucius and Lao Tzu continue to influence both literature and life philosophy. 
							From Japan, Eiji Yoshikawa’s historical epics, Haruki Murakami’s surreal modern 
							tales, and Osamu Dazai’s poignant explorations of despair and identity enrich the 
							literary canon. These timeless creations offer not just entertainment but also 
							insights into the complexities of human thought, culture, and history, 
							transcending boundaries and resonating across generations.

							The literary world is vast, with countless authors contributing to its richness and diversity.
							The haunting brilliance of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein continues to probe the ethics of scientific 
							advancement, while Homer’s ancient epics, The Iliad and The Odyssey, remain foundational to 
							Western literature. Dante Alighieri’s Divine Comedy offers a profound exploration of morality, 
							spirituality, and redemption, and Miguel de Cervantes’ Don Quixote brings humor and humanity to 
							the quest for ideals. The philosophical musings of Friedrich Nietzsche challenge perceptions of 
							existence, while the poetic beauty of Rabindranath Tagore captures the essence of human emotions and 
							spirituality. In African literature, Chinua Achebe’s Things Fall Apart delves into the collision 
							between tradition and colonialism, and Rumi’s poetry bridges the spiritual and the universal. 
							The works of Japanese authors like Yukio Mishima and Kenzaburo Oe bring poignant reflections on 
							identity and post-war struggles, while Franz Kafka’s surreal tales highlight the absurdities of 
							modern existence. These and many more great minds have contributed narratives that traverse genres 
							like philosophy, drama, short stories, epics, and more, creating a legacy that inspires readers across 
							generations and borders.
